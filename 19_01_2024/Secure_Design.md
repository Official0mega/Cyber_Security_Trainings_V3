## CIA Triad.
* The CIA Triad is a foundational model that helps inform how orgnizatoins consider risks when setting up systems and security policies.

* Confidentiality:
    + Means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
    - For example, Strict access controls that defines who should and who should not have access to data, must be put in place to ensure confidential data remains safe.

* Integrity:
    + It means that the data is complete, correct, authentic and reliable.
    + To maintain integrity of data, security professionals can use a form of data protection
      like encryption, to safeguard data from being tampered with.

* Availability:
    + Means that data is available or accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

** WHAT IS AN ASSET? **
An Asset is an Item that is kind of, perceived as having some sort of value to a person or an organization.
** WHAT IS A VALUE? ** 
A value basically, is determined by the cost associated with the asset in question.

* A baseline to manage short and long term risk. Managing  and Mitigating risks and protecting an organization's assets  from threat actors are basically, the key responsibiliteis and goals for any security professionals.

## Security Guidelines.
1. Strong Passwords:
    + Use complex, unique paswords and update them regularly.
2. Multi-Factor Authentication(MFA):
    + Enable MFA to add an extra layer of Securiy to Data.
3. Regular Updates:
    + Keeps software, operating systems , and applications up to date to patch vulnerabilities.
4. Firewalls:
    + Implement firewalls to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
5. Data Encryption:
    + Encryption ensures that sensitive information and data are well protected from access to unauthorized users.
6. User Education:
    + Train employees on security best  practices to minimize human errors.
7. Incident Response Plan:
    + Develop and regularly test a plan for responding to security incidents.
8. Access Control:
    + Limit access to systems and data based on job roles and responsibilities.
9. Backup Data:
    + Regularly backup critical data to precent data loss from cyber threats and attacks.
10. Mobile Device Management (MDM):
    + Implement controls for secure use oof mobile devices in the workplace.
